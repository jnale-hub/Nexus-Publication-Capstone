### Implementations I need to do

- Make the games accessible even the user in not authenticated

- Wordle settings: I want to have the selection from easy to hard, but then I need to modify the statistics, then the models. I also need to modify the javascript to cater different guesses lengths.

- Wordle variations: like four letters, six letters, or even seven, and that means that I need a diferent datas to get from, which I dont have at the moment.

- Rinconada wordle: I  want to make it very personalized and have a little moving tips like if `paroy` is  the word the hint would be `something that we harvest` like that.

- The other games, I want to build that quiz bee and spelling bee but I know it will take a lot of time and effort. But hopefully I could handle it.

- Maximise the news api, I want to have a selection of countries that filters it out.

- Make a variable in article `is_headline` so that the admin can manipulate whether an artice needs to be on the headline, and not just the latest article.

### Lesson Learned

- I should commit more often

- I realized that you can open two terminal, so you can commit even the server is running. I thought that it was such a hassle to always `control + c` to stop the server and to commit and run the server again, but gosh how stupid.

- I also learned that you can copy relevant path to easily put the file you can add. I always do `git add .` when I try to commit and the whole things comes with it. I should have commit every chunk of code that I added so that I can easily track the chnges I made the whole time. Now, I commit often and I am getting better at it, I also learned that when I commit I should use imperative tone :>

- I should write more, so that I can improve my typing skills because it's fun, lol. I kinda missed writing short stories so it can be more nurishing rather than just coding and getting stressed from time to time.

### Ideas and Plans 

- Update the Rankings with Javascript

- In wordle rankings, I am kind of bothered that the data in the statistics section get updated even without reloading, so it is alos  great idea that the ranking do that too, but I know it will take more effort and my javascript is not that advance to to build the best javascript code with animation in them like an arrow down or even arrow up if the place changed. 

- So one thing that I think can be an alternatve is just put a little question mark there that says 'the page needs to reload to get the latest ranking' like that.

- I also want to have 'see more' button so that it would not limit to just top 5.
