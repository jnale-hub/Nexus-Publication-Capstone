### Lesson Learned

- I should commit more often

    I realized that you can open two terminal, so you can commit even the server is running. I thought that it was such a hassle to always `control + c` to stop the server and to commit and run the server again, but gosh how stupid lol.

    I also learned that you can copy relevant path to easily put the file you can add, lol. I always do `git add .` when I try to commit and the whole things comes with it. I should have commit every chunk of code that I added so that I can easily track the chnges I made the whole time. Now, I commit often and I am getting better at it, I also learned that when I commit I should use imperative tone :>

> I should write more, so that I can improve my typing skills because it's fun, lol. I kinda missed writing short stories so it can be more nurishing rather than just coding and getting stressed from time to time.
