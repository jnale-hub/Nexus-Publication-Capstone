# CAPSTONE - Nexus-Publication
#### Demo video:  <>

HI there!

This is my Final Project for the course CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. It is built with  Django, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and Bootstrap.

Nexus Publication is the name of my college's school paper so I wanted to make web app that can have articles, have a game section, and can browse for world news. 

The main inspiration for this project is The New York Times Games, I love playing wordle and I tried to make my own. And why not make a web app for my school paper and have games section in it.
